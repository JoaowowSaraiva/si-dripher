# Dripher

A litle project build for Computer Security, a discipline of our graduation in Informatic Engineering

# **1. What is it ?**

This project aims to implement a simple application for encryption and decryption of files, as well as for digital signature and integrity control. The idea is for the program to monitor a set of folders created by the application itself during installation by a user. Each folder corresponds to an application function that is activated after a user drags one or more files there (eg, when a user drags a file to the Encrypt folder, the program encrypts the file and moves the result to the Encrypted folder and so on)

Some of the comments are in Portuguese but it will be changed as soon as possible
