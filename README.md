## Dripher

A litle project build for Computer Security, a discipline of our graduation in Informatic Engineering

## **1. What is it ?**

This project aims to implement a simple application for encryption and decryption of files, as well as for digital signature and integrity control. The idea is for the program to monitor a set of folders created by the application itself during installation by a user. Each folder corresponds to an application function that is activated after a user drags one or more files there (eg, when a user drags a file to the Encrypt folder, the program encrypts the file and moves the result to the Encrypted folder and so on)

Some of the comments are in Portuguese but it will be changed as soon as possible

## **2. Installation and usability**

- Our project have a *Makefile* with it you can install, compile and run _**dripher**_, you can also clean some files with it or read his info by doing _make info_ on your terminal.

- Our program sources is the file named dripher.c

### **2.1 Installation**

* By typing _**make install**_ your program will get everything you need. It will create the folders that the program use and it will compile the sources.

  Thit is basically what you need to install _**dripher**_.
